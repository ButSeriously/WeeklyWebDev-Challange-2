# WeeklyWebDev-PSD2

PSD2HTML exercise from Weekly WebDEV Facebook group.

That project is going to get updates in the future. No I'm busy with learning React library, but you can see below what types of changes will be provided in next releases:
* hover effects
* additional breakpoints for more devices
* "sticky" navbar with link underlines
* general code refactor
